        '"Explorations in Design" gives students the opportunity to apply their unique backgrounds to the realm of design. Students will engage in hands-on learning with real world applications to incorporate design thinking into everyday life. By exploring each stage of the design process (from ideating to prototyping), students will develop a final project to pitch at the end of the semester.',

        'What does "User Experience" mean? It was a term coined by cognitive psychologist and designer Don Norman in the 1990s on the cusp of the new digital era; however, the field in practice has existed long before that. Unfortunately, due to its over use and misuse, the pure concept of UX has become lost in the weeds and details of all of its components and methods. In this course, we will take a deep look at the true meaning of UX as simply a user\'s experience and what that means for you as both a designer and a user. You will learn about core UX principles and methodologies from both an academic and practical standpoint and be challenged to apply what you learn in classroom workshops and assignments. Finally, you will be asked to think both inside and outside the bounds of technology to find innovative solutions to real world design problems.',

        "Do mathematical objects exist? If so, in what way, and how are we allowed to reason about them? How do our answers to these questions affect our mathematics? Mathematicians have been arguing over the mathematical and philosophical foundations of math for as long as math has been around. We will go through ideas largely in their historical order of development, beginning with Platonism, then proceeding to the Formalism of Hilbert, the Constructivism of Bishop, and finishing with a look at various modern perspectives. Out of this debate, one thing is clear: our philosophical tastes inform which axioms we should accept (if any), what math we should do, and how we are allowed to do it. In this course, we will overview several of the prevailing philosophical viewpoints that have emerged. These perspectives are often at odds with each other, so this course is designed to help you develop your own perspective about these topics. This course will require both mathematical and philosophical discussion, as the philosophy will inform the mathematical systems we develop, and the consequences of the mathematical systems we develop will in turn inform our philosophy. We will be talking about the math arising from philosophical ideas as much as we will be talking about the philosophical ideas themselves.",
