              Teaching a STIC is hard work, and we want you to make sure you’re up for the task. Look over this <a target="_blank"  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dquY1L-s6lDlPWRnKdj6QRErvRCBu_-A1marOU8cn30/edit">responsibilities list</a>, and feel free to ask us about anything by emailing us at <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a>.

            <h2>When should I apply?</h2>
            <br>

	    <p>It is recommended that students interested in teaching a course in the Spring reach out to us by mid March. If it's past then, still feel free to get in touch and we'll see what we can do.</p>
	    
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> We now require all new & relist applications to include a copy of the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16aH374sD0tF8e0YEW6IOdo46rGCUbvAA/view?usp=sharing">Student-Faculty Agreement</a> signed by the faculty advisor and facilitators.</p>
	    
            <p> Submitting a draft syllabus to <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> is recommended. Check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7njaPci1mp3mk9TBXHTTJNOXD5iOWC3h1_495PMIJY/edit?usp=sharing">syllabus template</a> for help! Applicants looking to relist STICs should also contact their department and the STICs board as soon as possible.

            <h2>Important Notes</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
		<li>Depending on the department, Faculty advisors may only be able to advise up to 1 STIC at a time.</li>
		<li>Depending on the department, students may be restricted from acting as a TA for another course while facilitating a STIC.
		<li>Depending on the department, the student facilitator role may be a volunteer position, paid position, or a study credit opportunity.</li>
		<li>Please reach out to <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> with any questions about the application process!</li>

            <h2>How do I apply?</h2>
            <br>
	    
            <h3>Step 1: Plan Your Topic</h3>
	    <p>Think about what class you would want to create. Make sure that your course topic is both related to your major and unqiue (check that no current course covers your course topic). We advise you to discuss your course topic with professors, so you can get feedback before you move forward with your application. Finally, Create a one paragraph description of your course where you include a title, course objectives, and any other relevant information. This is the information you want to use to convince someone the course is needed and relevant.</p>

	    <h3>Step 2: Find a Faculty Advisor</h3>
            <p>
              Faculty advisors are required for every STIC. You must find a faculty advisor that is part of the department you want your class offered in (i.e., an ARTT course would have an ARTT faculty advisor). Your faculty advisor should be someone who trusts you and would feel comfortable supervising and taking responsibility for your class. You can find an outline of what to look for in a faculty advisor <a target="_blank"  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c81bq5qzxsRwFHC6SItoWc0ya5Zxa4Bq7NvIAlWlfCc">here</a>.
              <br><br>
              Once you have found an advisor, review the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16aH374sD0tF8e0YEW6IOdo46rGCUbvAA/view?usp=sharing">Student-Faculty Agreement</a> with him/her. Both you and your faculty advisor must sign this document, and you are responsible for emailing a copy of the signed document to <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> as part of your application.
            </p>
	    
            <h3>Step 3: Create a Full Syllabus</h3>
            <p>After finding a faculty advisor, develop a syllabus including a schedule and course outline. Think about what class you would want to create, and make a 15 week schedule for it. We recommend outlining sample quizzes, homeworks, and/or tests at this time to help you adjust the scope of your class if necessary. Make sure to discuss your syllabus with your faculty advisor. Head over to our <a target="_blank" href="catalog.html">catalog</a> and check our some existing syllabi (preferably from your department or ones “like” yours) as examples. In addition, we also have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7njaPci1mp3mk9TBXHTTJNOXD5iOWC3h1_495PMIJY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">syllabus template</a> you may follow.</p>
	    
            <h3>Step 4: Reach Out to STICs</h3>
            <p>
              Message us via email at <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a>. Please share with us the syllabus and class title. We will help you through the next step (finding a faculty advisor), review your materials, and advise you on anything that we think will make your class more likely to be approved by the department.
              <!-- <br><br> -->
              <!-- This step must be completed by <strong class="highlight">March 22nd, 2019</strong> -->
            </p>
	    
            <h3>Step 5: Review + Iterate</h3>
            <p>You will need to iterate until your faculty advisor is satisfied with the syllabus.</p>
	    
            <h3>Step 6: Department Approval</h3>
            <p>
              Now you're ready to apply to get department approval for your course! Apply <a href="https://forms.gle/LAiJPzEXPC8ffhnXA">here!</a>
