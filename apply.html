            Teaching a STIC is hard work, and we want you to make sure you’re up for the task.

          <br>
          <h3><strong>New Proposals:</strong></h3>
          <p> If your STIC proposal is for departments other than CMSC or MATH, submitting a draft syllabus to <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> by <strong class="highlight">March 13th, 2020</strong> is recommended. Check out our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7njaPci1mp3mk9TBXHTTJNOXD5iOWC3h1_495PMIJY/edit?usp=sharing">syllabus template</a> for help! This will give you enough time to navigate the listing process with your department and get listed in time for registration season. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> for more information.</p>
          <h3>Relist applications:</h3>
          <p>Contacting your department and the STICs board by <strong class="highlight">March 13th, 2020</strong> is recommended. This will give you enough time to navigate the listing process with your department and get listed in time for registration season.

          <h2>How do I apply?</h2>
          <br>

          <h3>Step 1: Plan Your Topic</h3>
          <p>Think about what class you would want to create, and make a 15 week schedule for it. We recommend outlining sample quizzes, homeworks, and/or tests at this time to help you adjust the scope of your class if necessary.</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Create a Full Syllabus</h3>
          <p>With your 15 week schedule completed, create a full syllabus for your course. Head over to our <a target="_blank" href="catalog.html">catalog</a> and check our some existing syllabi (preferably from your department or ones “like” yours) as examples. In addition, we also have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7njaPci1mp3mk9TBXHTTJNOXD5iOWC3h1_495PMIJY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">syllabus template</a> you may follow.</p>

          <h3>Step 3: Reach Out to STICs</h3>
          <p>
            Message us via email at <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> or our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/umdstics/">Facebook page</a> (whichever medium you are more responsive on). Please share with us the syllabus and class title. We will help you through the next step (finding a faculty advisor), review your materials, and advise you on anything that we think will make your class more likely to be approved by the department.
            <!-- <br><br> -->
            <!-- This step must be completed by <strong class="highlight">March 22nd, 2019</strong> -->
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4: Find a Faculty Advisor</h3>
          <p>
            Faculty advisors are required for every STIC. You must find a faculty advisor that is part of the department you want your class offered in (i.e., an ARTT course would have an ARTT faculty advisor). Your faculty advisor should be someone who trusts you and would feel comfortable supervising and taking responsibility for your class. You can find an outline of what to look for in a faculty advisor <a target="_blank"  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c81bq5qzxsRwFHC6SItoWc0ya5Zxa4Bq7NvIAlWlfCc">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            If you are having trouble finding an advisor, we suggest cold emailing! <a target="_blank"  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zutuF5kSNMff0hJj-1IFQBaJRjaFATYL668s_Na3Duw/edit">This</a> document may help you craft the emails.
            <br><br>
              Once you have found an advisor, review the <a target="_blank" href=" https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xs00rrvn-1ZdosPLI-gaGv6z1djQM1_ooazHt8j2Eus/edit?usp=sharing">Student-Faculty Agreement</a> with him/her. Both you and your faculty advisor must sign this document, and you are responsible for emailing a copy of the signed document to <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> as part of your application.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 5: Review + Iterate</h3>
          <p>You will need to iterate until your faculty advisor is satisfied with the syllabus.</p>

          <h3>Step 6: Department Approval</h3>
          <p>
            Reach out to us again and we will submit your course proposal to your department’s director of undergraduate studies, and potentially continue to iterate on material, scope, and syllabus until the course is approved!
