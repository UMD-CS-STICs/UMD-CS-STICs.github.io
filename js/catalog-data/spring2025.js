The goal of this course is to explore the idea that students’ habit building is much simpler than just freeing up more time or working harder. Throughout the semester, you will learn about how students can be taught to build consistent long- term habits and apply these skills to improve learning outcomes. The course will also delve into student motivations in habit building to work towards personal goals in their health, career, or other endeavors.",
