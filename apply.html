          <p>
            Any UMD student (both undergraduate and graduate) can apply to teach.
            <br><br>
            Teaching a STIC is hard work, and we want you to make sure you’re up for the task. Look over this <a target="_blank"  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dquY1L-s6lDlPWRnKdj6QRErvRCBu_-A1marOU8cn30/edit">responsibilities list</a>, and feel free to ask us about anything by messaging our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/umdstics/">Facebook page</a>, and/or emailing us at <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a>.

          <h2>how do I apply?</h2>
          <span class="divider"></span>

          <h3>Step 1: Plan Your Topic</h3>
          <p>Think about what class you would want to create, and make a 15 week schedule for it. We recommend outlining sample quizzes, homeworks, and/or tests at this time to help you adjust the scope of your class if necessary.</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Create a Full Syllabus</h3>
          <p>With your 15 week schedule completed, create a full syllabus for your course. Head over to our <a target="_blank" href="catalog.html">catalog</a> and check our some existing syllabi (preferrably from your department or ones “like” your’s) as examples.</p>

          <h3>Step 3: Reach Out to STICs</h3>
          <p>
            Message us via email at <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> or our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/umdstics/">Facebook page</a> (whichever medium you are more responsive on). Please share with us the syllabus and class title. We will help you through the next step (finding a faculty advisor), review your materials, and advise you on anything that we think will make your class more likely to be approved by the department.
            <br><br>
            This step must be completed by <strong class="highlight">October 31st, 2018</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4: Find a Faculty Advisor</h3>
          <p>
            Faculty advisors are required for every STIC. You must find a faculty advisor that is part of the department you want your class offered in (i.e., an ARTT course would have an ARTT faculty advisor). Your faculty advisor should be someone who trusts you and would feel comfortable supervising and taking responsibility for your class. You can find an outline of what to look for in a faculty advisor <a target="_blank"  href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c81bq5qzxsRwFHC6SItoWc0ya5Zxa4Bq7NvIAlWlfCc">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            If you are having trouble finding an advisor, we suggest cold emailing! <a target="_blank"  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zutuF5kSNMff0hJj-1IFQBaJRjaFATYL668s_Na3Duw/edit">This</a> document may help you craft the emails.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 5: Review + Iterate</h3>
          <p>You will need to iterate until your faculty advisor is satisfied with the syllabus.</p>

          <h3>Step 6: Department Approval</h3>
          <p>
            Reach out to us again and we will submit your course proposal to your department’s director of undergraduate studies, and potentially continue to iterate on material, scope, and syllabus until the course is approved!
