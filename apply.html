            <p>Applications to teach a STIC in Spring 2026 are now closed. If you are still interested in teaching a course, contact us at <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a> and we'll see what we can do!</p>
            <h2>Who can teach?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              Any UMD student (both undergraduate and graduate) can apply to teach.

              Teaching a STIC is hard work, and we want you to make sure you’re up for the task. Once you become a STICs facilitator, you will be added the STICs Slack and can communicate with other facilitators for tips and questions!

            <h2>How do I apply?</h2>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 1: Plan Your Topic</h3>
            <p>Think about what class you would want to create. Make sure that your course topic is both related to your
              major and unqiue (check that no current course covers your course topic). We advise you to discuss your
              course topic with professors, so you can get feedback before you move forward with your application.
              Finally, Create a one paragraph description of your course where you include a title, course objectives,
              and any other relevant information. This is the information you want to use to convince someone the course
              is needed and relevant.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Find a Faculty Advisor</h3>
            <p>
              Faculty advisors are required for every STIC. You must find a faculty advisor that is part of the
              department you want your class offered in (i.e., an ARTT course would have an ARTT faculty advisor). Your
              faculty advisor should be someone who trusts you and would feel comfortable supervising and taking
              responsibility for your class. You can find an outline of what to look for in a faculty advisor <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c81bq5qzxsRwFHC6SItoWc0ya5Zxa4Bq7NvIAlWlfCc">here</a>.
              <br>
              <br>
              Once you have found an advisor, review the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16aH374sD0tF8e0YEW6IOdo46rGCUbvAA/view?usp=sharing">Student-Faculty
                Agreement</a> with him/her. Both you and your faculty advisor must sign this document, and you are
              responsible for emailing a copy of the signed document to <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a>
              as part of your application.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Create a Full Syllabus</h3>
            <p>After finding a faculty advisor, develop a syllabus including a schedule and course outline. Think about
              what class you would want to create, and make a 15 week schedule for it. We recommend outlining sample
              quizzes, homeworks, and/or tests at this time to help you adjust the scope of your class if necessary.
              Make sure to discuss your syllabus with your faculty advisor. Head over to our <a target="_blank"
                href="catalog.html">catalog</a> and check our some existing syllabi (preferably from your department or
              ones “like” yours) as examples. In addition, we also have a <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7njaPci1mp3mk9TBXHTTJNOXD5iOWC3h1_495PMIJY/edit?usp=sharing"
                target="_blank">syllabus template</a> you may follow.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Reach Out to STICs</h3>
            <p>
              Message us via email at <a href="mailto:stics@umd.edu">stics@umd.edu</a>. Please share with us the
              syllabus and class title. We will help you through the next step (finding a faculty advisor), review your
              materials, and advise you on anything that we think will make your class more likely to be approved by the
              department.
              <!-- <br><br> -->
              <!-- This step must be completed by <strong class="highlight">March 22nd, 2019</strong> -->
            </p>

            <h3>Step 5: Review + Iterate</h3>
            <p>You will need to iterate until your faculty advisor is satisfied with the syllabus.</p>

            <h3>Step 6: Department Approval</h3>
            <p>
              Now you're ready to apply to get department approval for your course!
